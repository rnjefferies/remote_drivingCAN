Since your system is using NetworkManager to manage network devices, you can configure the static IP addresses using the NetworkManager GUI or by editing the appropriate connection files. Here's how to do it both ways:

### Method 1: Using NetworkManager GUI

1. **Open Network Settings**:
   - Click on the network icon in the system tray (top-right corner) and select "Settings" or "Network Settings".

2. **Edit Connection**:
   - Select the wired connection you want to configure (typically named "Wired connection 1" or similar) and click on the gear icon to edit the settings.

3. **Set Static IP**:
   - Go to the "IPv4" tab.
   - Change the method from "Automatic (DHCP)" to "Manual".
   - Enter the following details:
     - Address: `192.168.1.1` (for PC1) or `192.168.1.2` (for PC2)
     - Netmask: `255.255.255.0`
     - Gateway: `
     ` (for both PCs)
     - DNS: `8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4`
   - Click "Save".

4. **Repeat on the Second PC**:
   - Follow the same steps on the second PC, setting the IP address to `192.168.1.2`.

### Method 2: Using NetworkManager CLI (nmcli)

If you prefer using the command line, you can use `nmcli` to configure the network settings.

#### On PC1:

1. **Set a Static IP**:
   ```bash
   sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.1/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4" ipv4.method manual
   ```

2. **Apply the Changes**:
   ```bash
   sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
   ```

#### On PC2:

1. **Set a Static IP**:
   ```bash
   sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.2/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4" ipv4.method manual
   ```

2. **Apply the Changes**:
   ```bash
   sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
   ```

### Verification

After setting up the static IP addresses, you can verify the connection by pinging each PC from the other:

- **From PC1**:
  ```bash
  ping 192.168.1.2
  ```

- **From PC2**:
  ```bash
  ping 192.168.1.1
  ```

If the pings are successful, the connection is properly established.

### File Sharing (Optional)

To share files between the PCs, you can use SSH or Samba, as outlined in the previous message. Hereâ€™s a quick summary:

#### Using SSH:

1. **Install OpenSSH Server**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openssh-server
   ```

2. **Connect via SSH**:
   - From PC1 to PC2:
     ```bash
     ssh username@192.168.1.2
     ```
   - From PC2 to PC1:
     ```bash
     ssh username@192.168.1.1
     ```

#### Using Samba:

1. **Install Samba**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install samba
   ```

2. **Configure Samba**:
   - Edit `/etc/samba/smb.conf` to add a shared folder configuration.
   - Restart Samba with `sudo systemctl restart smbd`.

3. **Access the Share**:
   - Use `smbclient` to access the shared folder from the other PC.
